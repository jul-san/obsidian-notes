## Instructions for a Machine
- An HLL statement is typically represented by several assembly instructions
- Assembly instruction is generally a symbolic representation of a machine instruction

### Example:
- find an image for later

## Advantages of Using an HLL
- Programmer can think about a problem in a more natural language
- More productive
- More maintainable
- Applications can be independent of the computer they were developed on
- Highly optimized compilers can produce efficient assembly code

## Who Uses Assembly
- Most programming is done in HLL's
- Some cases to write in assembly:
	- Wanting code to interact directly with hardware
	- High performance libraries
	- Tune the CPU
	- You can develop an application for an embedded processor

## Why Learn Assembly
- Helps to understand concepts in computer organization
- Understand certain HLL concepts:
	- pointers
	- parameter passing (pass-by-value, pass-by-reference)
- Understand performance implications
