## Layers
- Computers are organized into layers

- Application Software
	- Programs invoked by the user
- Systems Software
	- Operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS)
	- Allocates storage and memory
	- Allows multiple applications to share a computer
- Hardware
	- CPU, Memory, etc.

## Program Levels
- There are multiple levels of software/ hardware that go into the creation of a computer
### High Level Language
- The level used by programmers to develop applications
- Utilizes programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, Rust, etc.
### Assembly Language
- Symbolic representation of instructions
- This level is the interface between HLL and machine code (binary)
- The compiler translates HLL's into assembly
### Machine Language
- Binary representation of everything that was just stated, aka zeros and ones
---
## Translating Between Levels
- There are several tools that were mentioned briefly that help to translate between levels
### Compiler
- Translates HLL files an assembly language file
### Assembler
- Translates assembly into machine language
### Linker
- Translates machine language into an executable file that can be loaded into memory

### Example of Translating
