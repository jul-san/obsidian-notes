### Moore's Law
- Number of transistors on a chip doubles every 18-24 months
- Architects anticipate the state of tech from now
- Number eventually slowed down over time

### Abstraction to Simplify
- Used to represent different levels of a design
- Small details can be hidden to make room for higher-level information

### Make the Common Case First
- Improve the case that appears the most first
- Usually the most efficient when fixing errors

### Improve Performance via Parallelism
- Perform multiple operations at the same time
- Improves efficiency when dealing with a large amount of data

### Improve Performance via Pipelining
- Break tasks into different stages
- Multiple tasks can be completed in different stages

### Improve Performance via Prediction
- Can be faster to assume the outcome of a product instead of waiting

### Hierarchy of Memories
- Allow the fastest, smallest, and most expensive bit get accessed first

### Improve Dependability via Redundancy
- Be sure to include components that may often seem redundant
- Could be the fix to a certain issue
