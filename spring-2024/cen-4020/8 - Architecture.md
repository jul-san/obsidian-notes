## Architectural Design
- Concerned with:
    - Understanding how a software system should be organized and designing the overall structure of that system
- Is the critical link between design and requirements engineering:
    - Identifies the main structural components in a systema and the relationships between them
- Output of the architectural process
    - An architectural model that describes how the system is organized as a set of communicating components

## Architectural Abstraction
- Architecture in the small:
    - The architecture of the individual programs
    - Concerned with the way that an individual program is decomposed into components
- Architecture in large:
    - The architecture of a complex enterprise system the include other systems, programs, and program components
    - Enterprise systems may be distributed over different computers, which may be owned and managed by different companies


## Advantages of Explicit Architecture
- Stakeholder Communication:
    - Architecture may be used as a focus of discussion by system stakeholders
- System Analysis:
    - Means that the analysis of whether the system can meet its non-functional requirements is possible
- Documenting an architecture that has been designed:
    - A complete system model that shows different components in a system, interfaces and their connections
- Large-scale Resuse:
    - Systems in the same domain often have similar architectures
    - Systems may be architected around one or more architectural patters

## Architectural Representations
- Informal block diagrams:
    - Shows entities and relationships
    - Most frequently used method
- Have been criticized because:
    - Lacks semantics
    - Does not show the types of relationships between entities nor the visible properties of entities in the architecture
- Depends of the use of architectural models
    - Requirements for the model semantics depend on how the models are used
- Useful for communication with stakeholders and project planning
