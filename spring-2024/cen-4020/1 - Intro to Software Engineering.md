## Why So Many Software Bugs?
- Building is tedious and error-prone
	- Growth of software complexity
	- High demand for human resources

- Testing, profiling, and analyzing is difficult
	- Computationally expensive
	- Requires user interaction

- Multiple tools needed at the same time
	- Provides checkable guarantees
	- Fully automated and easy to use
	- Scalable

## Software Engineering Roots
- Inspired by methods in applied science
	- e.g., physicists in 17-19th centuries

- Levels of abstraction
	- Specifications give rough idea
	- Incremental development
	- Maintenance allows for incarnation of software

## Software Engineering Definition

<p style="text-align: center"><i><b>The application of a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.</b></i></p>

- Encompasses issues relating to:
	- Getting requirements from clients
	- Designing software
	- Writing code
	- Testing, deploying, and maintaining
	- Modifying existing functionality
	- Project management
	- Teamwork
	- Human factors

- Aims at the production of **fault-free** software that satisfies the client

## Software Engineer vs Software Developer
- Used interchangeably
- Job requirements have their differences
### Software Developer 
- Responsible for writing code and building software
	- Make sure code works by testing
	- Make any required changes before production to ensure functionality
- Work with other members of a development team
	- Designers, engineers, analysts
	- Understand project specifications
	- Create apps in line with the specifications
- Follow development lifecycle methodology

### Software Engineer
- Does everything a software developer does
- Conscious of engineering design
	- Ensures the product is created efficiently
- Can be involved in all stages of the the development cycle
	- Analyzing problems
	- Writing
	- Debugging
	- Testing
	- Evaluating effectiveness of the solution
- Collaborate with data scientists, business users, project managers, and other engineers
	- Achieve elegant solutions
	- Provide recommendations for improvement
	- Elevate technology
