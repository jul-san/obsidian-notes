## Beginning of Software
- Software was separated from hardware in the 1950s
    - emerged as a distinct technology
    - became an independent product
    - term "**software**": 1958
- Original programers recruited from hardware engineers and mathematicians
    - used ad-hoc techniques from their former fields
    - writing software was seen as art
    - software is small in size and complexity

## Software Process Models Today
- Waterfall model
    - Plan-driven model, separate and distinct phases of specification and development
- Incremental Development
    - Specification, development, and validation are interleaved (plan-driven or agile)
- Integration and Configuration
    - System is assembled from existing configurable components
- Most large systems incorporate all of these models
