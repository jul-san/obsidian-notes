## Beginning of Software
- Software was separated from hardware in the 1950s
    - emerged as a distinct technology
    - became an independent product
    - term "**software**": 1958
- Original programers recruited from hardware engineers and mathematicians
    - used ad-hoc techniques from their former fields
    - writing software was seen as art
    - software is small in size and complexity

## Software Process Models Today
- Waterfall model
    - Plan-driven model, separate and distinct phases of specification and development
- Incremental Development
    - Specification, development, and validation are interleaved (plan-driven or agile)
- Integration and Configuration
    - System is assembled from existing configurable components
- Most large systems incorporate all of these models

## Waterfall Model

### Waterfall Advantages
- Suitable for very well understood but complex projects
    - Tackles all planning up-front
    - Idea of a no midstream changes equats to an efficient software development process
- Supports inexperienced teams
    - Orderly, easy-to-follow sequential models

### Waterfall Model Problems
- Inflexibile paritioning of the project into distinct stages
    - Makes it difficult to respond to changing customer requirements
    - Does not allow for complex changes during the design process
    - Changes require customer approvals that delays the overall development process
- Not applicable to business systems
    - Few businesses systems have stable requirements

## Incremental Development

### About
- Plan driven
    - System increments are identified in advance
- Agile
    - Early increments are identified
    - Development of later increments are identified based on progress and priorities
- Mixture
    - Reflect the way we solve problems: come components can be planned; but some uncertain parts go agile

## Incremental Development Benefits
- Cost of accomodation changing requirements is reduced
    - Amount of analysis and documenttion is much less required
- Easier to get customer feedback
    - Customers can comment on demonstrations of the software
- More rapid delivery and deployment 
    - Customer are able to use and gain software much faster

## Incremental Development Problems
- Process is not visible
    - Need regular deliverables to measure progress
    - If developed quickly, it is not cost-effective to develop documentation
- Structure tends to degrade as new increments are added
    - Regular changes tend to corrupt its structure
    - Incorporating further software changes become increasingly difficult and costly
