## Requirements Engineering (Recap)
**- Process of establishing the services that a customer requires from a system and the constraints under which it operates and is developed**

## Functional Vs. Non-functional

### Functional 
- Method *m* always terminates
- If the input is positive number, the program returns its inverse
- Variable *x* always stores the value 0
- This input runs into a race condition
- The program crashes with input 3

### Non-functional
- There are no loops in method *m*
- The code is indented using tabs
- There are 3 lines of comments for every executable line
- Each class has at least 3 subclasses
- This class only has integer attributes

## Requirements Elicitation
- Software engineers work with a range of system stakeholders:
    - To find out about the application domain
    - The services that the system should provide
    - The required system performance
    - Hardware constraints
    - Other systems, etc.
- Stages Include:
    - Discovery
    - Classification and organization
    - Prioritization and negotiation
    - Specification

## Problems of Requirement Elicitation
- Stakeholder don't know what they really want
- Stakeholders express requirements in their own terms
- Different stakeholders may have conflicting requirements
- Organizational and political factors may influence the system requirements
- Requirements change during the analysis process
- New stakeholders may emerge and the business environment may change

## Requirements Elicitation and Analysis Process

### Requirements Discovery
- Interacting with stakeholders to discover their requirements
- Domain requirements are also discovered at this stage

### Requirements Classification and Organization
- Groups related requirements and organizes them into coherent clusters

### Requirements Prioritization and Negotiation
- Prioritizing requirements and resolving requirements conflicts

### Requirements Specification
- Requirements are documented and input into the next round of the spiral

## Requirements Discovery: Interviewing
- Formal or informal interviews with stakeholders are part of most RE prcoesses
- Types of interviews:
    - Closed interviews based on pre-determined list of questions
    - Open interviews where various issues are explored with stakeholders
- Effective interviewing:
    - Be open-minded, avoid pre-conceived ideas about the requirements and are willing to listen to stakeholders
    - Prompt the interviewee to get a discussion going by using:
        - A springboard question
        - A requirements proposal
        - Working together to prototype of system
