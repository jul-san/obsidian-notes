## Requirements Engineering
- Process of establishing services that the customer requires from a system
- Also establish the restraints of the system

## What is a Requirement?
- Descriptions of system services and constraints that are generated during the engineering process
- Can range from a high-level abstraction to a mathematical function specification
- Requirements may serve dual functions:
    - May be the basis for a bid contract; open to interpretation
    - May be the basis for a contract itself; defined in detail
    - Both of these may be requirements
