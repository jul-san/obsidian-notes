# Chapter 1 - Introduction

## Help In the Unix World
- "**man**" program has been the primary means for local documentation
    - "**man man**": find out more
    - "**man -k KEYWORD**": search for a keyword in man pages
- In most Unix/Linux distros, the man pages are generally directories
- "**info**" program is useful, but it's nice be skillful with Emacs alongside it

## Linux
- Been around for 30 years
- The leading platform for operating system development
- Mint is apparently the most popular distro, but it's arguable that Ubuntu is
