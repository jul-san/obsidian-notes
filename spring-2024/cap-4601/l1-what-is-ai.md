# Lecture 1: What is Artificial Intelligence?

## What is AI?
- Tons of definitions, however, most contain bias
    - Thinking or acting?
    - Humanly or rationally?

## Definitions of AI
|           | Humanly | Rationally |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Thinking  | **Thinking Humanly**: cognitive modeling, systems should solve problems using the human way | **Thinking Rationally**: use of logic and probability |
| Acting    | **Acting Humanly**: Turing Test | **Acting Rationally**: the study of rational agents. Agents that maximize the expected value of their performance matrix. |

## Current Consensus Definition
- AI is the study of intelligence, rational agents:
    - Perception/sensing
    - Thinking/reasoning/inference
    - Acting
- For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that will maximize its performance measure

## Strong v.s. Weak AI
- Weak AI: as if intelligent
- Strong AI: actually intelligent

**Artificial General Intelligence** - hypothetical intelligence of a machine that has the capacity to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human can
